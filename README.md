<b>Installation</b>

You just need python3 to run this (and some python libraries).
Or you can use the compiled version for windows (dist folder)

<b>Getting started</b>

You need HQ Https Proxies if you want to use multi-threading,

Configure the settings.json file with your xbox credentials.
Put the name of proxy file in the same directory, or put 'false' for no proxies.
